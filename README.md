# YOLAMTAN Bot

For Owen and friends, by Owen and friends.

Hey, we should fill more of this out.

In order to run this bot, you need the following packages, probably more. Install using pip.
- ffmpeg
- discord
- discord.py

There's a special case with ffmpeg where you *must* add the directory ffmpeg.exe is located at to the windows PATH.
- Download ffmpeg by getting lastest here: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
- Move to a sensible place and add directory to ffmpeg.exe to PATH
- Restart terminal
